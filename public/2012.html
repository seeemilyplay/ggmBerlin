        <div class="description">
          This session introduces the idea of functional programming within the broader context of the computer language eco-system. We'll start off by looking at the the sort of programming that should be familiar to any developer (with if-statements, loops and variables), and then from there introduce some functional programming concepts. Aimed at people who are just starting out in the coding world, but it will be suitable for experienced coders who don't know what functional programming is too; although the first 10mins will be familiar stuff.

          In order for founders and product managers of young businesses to be successful with their products, they need to figure out how to create for a good user experience and what UX can they contribute to the bottom line in terms of small budgets and tight deadlines. I hope my speech will help them to learn what they can do on their own in order to fix at least the most serious problems lying around in plain sight before bringing in someone with UX background and expertise.

It was invented for telecommunication systems and is meanwhile used for e.g. payment platforms or online games. It's a functional programming language and well suited for distributed scalable systems. In this session I would like to briefly introduce Erlang to you and share why I enjoy working with it. If you are interested in programming and want learn a little about a different programming language this session might be interesting for you.

        <div class="description">
          Why do user research? It’s a lot of trouble to go out and talk with users when we could be getting “real work” done by designing, developing and launching a product.  But how do we know what we’re building is the right solution or solving the right problem in the first place?  To build things that truly improve people’s lives we have to understand our users’ context and the problems they face.  We’ll look at several user research techniques, most that can be done with small budgets.  These tools can improve your products by making them work better and improving the lives of your users.  Learn some basics and start applying them. Suitable for: designers, entrepreneurs, developers

This session is for all those with a curiosity for how search engines and ranking algorithms work. Not technical knowledge is needed as we will cover the theoretical foundations of the PageRank (such as the Random Walk and Markov Chains) with concrete examples. We will also explain how the PageRank is used in large search engines like Google's. We will finally present our own improved version of the PageRank, the DiscoRank, that supports universal search in the Next SoundCloud.
